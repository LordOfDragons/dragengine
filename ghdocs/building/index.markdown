# Building

You do __NOT__ have to build the game engine to play or create games.
Building is only required for Linux distribution maintainers or those
having a special use case.
{: .important }

# GIT Branches

The __master__ branch is the current development branch with the most recent work.
It is potentially unstable and should be only used by developers working on
bleeding edge software build against the upcoming release.

The __stable__ branch is the stable branch pointing to the latest release. This
branch is for public use by distribution builders and developers working on
software to work with the latest stable release.

All other branches are internal feature development and platform support branches
not intended for public use. If you want to work on these branches please get in
contact with the development team first.
