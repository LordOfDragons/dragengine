# To use rename to "custom.py" and uncomment the desired parameters.

# Most parameters in here are tri-state and accept the values 'auto', 'yes' and 'no'.
# Since this is a python file after all you can also use the values True and False
# instead of 'yes' and 'no' as well as all kinds of code you can use in python for
# example to adjust configuration on external parameters.
# 
# See dist.custom.py for platform independent options to add here.
#
