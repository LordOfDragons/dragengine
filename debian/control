Package: dragengine
Depends: delauncher-gui, ${misc:Depends}
Architecture: all
Description: Drag[en]gine Game Engine
 Required to play games using the Drag[en]gine Game Engine (*.delga).
 .
 This is a meta package installing the package "delauncher-gui".
 .
 Games present as packages should depend on the package "delauncher"
 instead of this one.

Package: delauncher-console
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Provides: delauncher
Description: Drag[en]gine Game Engine Console Launcher
 Required to play games using the Drag[en]gine Game Engine (*.delga).
 .
 The "delauncher-console" is for advanced users prefering running
 games from the console or using them in scripts. The console launcher
 supports similar features than the GUI launcher but can not create,
 edit or delete Game Profiles.
 .
 Game Profiles are used to configure the Drag[en]gine Game Engine.
 To run games creating profiles is not required. Defaults are used
 in that case. Creating profiles though can help to optimize running
 games as well as solving potential problems.

Package: delauncher-gui
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Provides: delauncher
Description: Drag[en]gine Game Engine GUI Launcher
 Required to play games using the Drag[en]gine Game Engine (*.delga).
 .
 For most users running "delauncher-gui" is preferred. This shows a GUI
 with the installed games. The GUI launcher supports:
   - Installing games and patches from *.delga files
   - Uninstalling games and patches
   - Running installed games
   - Create, edit and delete Game Profiles
 .
 Game Profiles are used to configure the Drag[en]gine Game Engine.
 To run games creating profiles is not required. Defaults are used
 in that case. Creating profiles though can help to optimize running
 games as well as solving potential problems.

Package: libdragengine1
Architecture: any

Package: libdragengine-dev
Architecture: any
Depends: libdragengine1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Drag[en]gine Game Engine Development
 Development files required to create Drag[en]gine Modules. This package
 is not required to create games using the Drag[en]gine Game Engine.

 modules for the public use.

Package: deigde
Architecture: any
Depends: deigde-data (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Drag[en]gine Game Development Environment
 Provides support to develop games using the Drag[en]gine Game Engine.
 Developing games does not required source code access so you do not
 need to install *-dev packages (especially not dragengine-dev or
 deigde-dev) unless the Scripting Module of your choice requires some.
 .
 Run deigde to start the editor. Creating, developing, test running
 and deploying games is done from inside the editor.
 .
