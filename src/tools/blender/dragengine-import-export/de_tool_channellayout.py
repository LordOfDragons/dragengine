		# correctly but trails at the end of the list. the reason for this bug is totally unknown. the
		# only remedy is deselect all channels before using the script. unfortunately blender does not
		# have an explicit deselect operator only a toggle operator. to get this all working the first
		# channel is selected. then the toggle seelction can be used to deselect all channels
