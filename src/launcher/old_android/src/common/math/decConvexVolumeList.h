/**
 * \brief Convex volume list.
 *
 * Sometimes it is useful to have a list of convex volumes that
 * describe some object or multiple objects. The Convex Volume
 * List takes on this task storing a list of convex volumes.
 * The Convex Volume List is also able to send split operations
 * down to the stored convex volumes. The newly generated convex
 * volumes are appended to the list. This way a single Convex
 * Volume List can be used to cut an original convex volume into
 * smaller pieces tied together in one handy place.
 *
 * The Convex Volume List does only provide storing convex volumes
 * and does not use any kind of spatial optimiziation like octrees
 * for example. If you need spatial optimization or if you are
 * using a large number of convex volumes writing your own class
 * is better than using this one which is designed for handling
 * convex volumes in an easy way but not necessary a fast way.
 *
 * You can use though this class as a temporary storage to split
 * your convex volumes and moving the result afterwards into a
 * better place. The extraction functions allow you to remove
 * convex volumes without deleting them.
