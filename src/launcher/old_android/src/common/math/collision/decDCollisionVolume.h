/**
 * @brief Base class for collision volumes.
 *
 * The collision detection system uses a double dispatch system
 * to determine collisions between various volumes. The first
 * dispatch call is VolumeHitsVolume. Each subclass has to call
 * a left side specialized function on either the caller or
 * itself to trigger the second dispatch. Left side functions
 * are those of the shape  *HitsVolume. Such a left side function
 * then has to call the approriate right side function which is
 * a function of the shape *Hits*. Collision detection is then
 * carried out by such a right side function. A collision check
 * requires though at most 2 dispatch calls in addition to the
 * execution time of the real collision routine.
 *
 * Although the name collision volumes suggests only volumes to
 * be used in collision detection this is not fully true. This
 * collision system also allows a ray as beeing a volume. Also
 * a triangle is strictly not a volume as it is infitesimal
 * small in one direction but is considered a collision volume.
 *
 * @note The Ray as a collision class doesn't really fit in the
 * big picture. A ray is an infinite object and not even a
 * volume. A solution would be to take out the ray class and
 * simply add a collision test call to the collision volume
 * class. This way the important functionality is conserved but
 * the troublesome ray class vanishes.
