 * \brief Container mapping a list of memory files into the virtual file system.

 * class is useful to add a small number of individual memory files
 * to the virtual file system. Each memory file is an individual chunk
 * of memory. For mapping a large block of memory into a virtual file
 * system containing various files inside this memory block the block
 * memory file class is better suited.
