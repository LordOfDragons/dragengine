/**
 * @brief Generic Quadtree Class.
 *
 * Provides the generic implementation of an quadtree algorithm. For real usage subclass
 * this class and implement the required functions. Every Quadtree object is the root of
 * an quadtree. The top most quadtree object with no parent is the real quadtree root and
 * all children virtual quadtree roots. The subclass overwrites the node creation function
 * to create nodes of its own class. Furthermore the subclass has to implement the
 * management of the node content. This quadtree class only provides the skeleton required
 * for an quadtree algorithm and does not implement any node content logic.

	 * Specified the constants used for the quadrants. There exists two equal
	 * versions suitable for different types of implementations. The first
	 * set of quadrant definitions is classified using the axis coordinates.
	 * They are also aligned in a way that the definition value represents
	 * a bit mask. The first bit is the x axis and the second the y axis. A set bit
	 * indicates positive direction and a 0 negative direction. This set is useful
	 * for implementations working with bit masks to identify quadrants. The second
	 * set of quadrant definitions uses verbal descriptions of the quadrants and is
	 * useful for implementations based around the logic location of an quadrant.
	 * Both sets include also a definition for a null quadrant. This is used by
	 * functions searching for quadrants to indicate that no matching quadrant could
	 * be found.
