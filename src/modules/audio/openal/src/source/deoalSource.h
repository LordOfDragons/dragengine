/**
 * OpenAL source object.
 * 
 * Keeps track of an openal source object. Sources are limited resources on the hardware and
 * have to be reused as much as possible to avoid running out of openal memory. A source
 * object is either unbound if not used by an engine resource or bound if in use. The
 * importance number is used to determine what source to reassign in case not enough sources
 * are available by the hardware and is located in the range from 0 to 1 where 1 is the most
 * important. The owner of an openal source object has to check before each access to the
 * source if it is still the owner. This avoids the need for callback mechanisms. Source
 * objects are only held by the deoalSourceManager. Users only store a pointer. The owner
 * is identified using a memory pointer location. If the owner releases the source it has to
 * set the owner pointer to NULL.
