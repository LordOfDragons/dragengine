/**
 * \brief OpenAL ray tracing world octree.
 * 
 * Optimized version of deoalWorldOctree for ray tracing. Octree is relative to a world
 * position which is typically the microphone or spaker. Components affected by ray tracing
 * are inserted into the octree and stored in a faster to visit way than deoalWorldOctree
 * can achieve. This octree also builds faster than deoalWorldOctree. For this reason flat
 * arrays are used with child nodes indexing into the array.
 * 
 * Building the octree is done in two phases. First an octree is build from scratch which
 * uses 8 optional child nodes as deoalOctree does. In the second phase a second octree is
 * build with only the existing child nodes packed as tightly as possible. This second
 * octree is then used for visiting.
 * 
 * Components in this octree are only visited by checking the bounding box. During building
 * the visitor has to prepare the component and check if the component has faces and is
 * matching layer mask. Once added no checks will be done anymore to get the highest
 * performance possible.
