	 * \brief Return formatted string using parameters applied to this string as format.
	 * 
	 * Format string has to contain tokens in the form (without blanks)
	 * "{" "index" ":" "flags" "field width" ".precision" "format" "}".
	 * 
	 * "index" indicates the index of the object to use from the parameters provided. Index
	 * can be omitted to use the occurance number of the token. First token found is index 0,
	 * second token found index 1 and so forth. Negative index counts from the end \em parameters.
	 * 
	 * If nothing or only "index" is present the ":" is not required to be used.
	 * 
	 * The character "{" is special. To insert a plain "{" use "{{". There is no need to
	 * escape "}" since it is special only after a non-escaped "{" is found. In all other
	 * cases it is inserted plain.
	 * 
	 * Flags are optional can be one ore more of these in any order:<br/>
	 * "0": Value is padded with "0" up to the desired length.<br/>
	 * "-": Value is padded with " " on the right side instead of the left side (left aligned).<br/>
	 * " ": Use " " for positive numbers to align with negative numbers.<br/>
	 * "+": Use "+" for positive numbers to align with negative numbers.<br/>
	 * 
	 * The "field width" defines the minimum field width. Depending on "format" this is used
	 * to pad up the value to fit into the field width. The value used for "field width"
	 * has to be a positive integer value.
	 * 
	 * The ".precision" indicates the number of digits after the point used for floating
	 * point values. The value has to be a positive integer value. Using 0 uses the highest
	 * precision possible.
	 * 
	 * The "format" indicates the format to apply to the fetched parameter and can be one
	 * of these values:<br/>
	 * "d" or "i": Integer value<br/>
	 * "o": Integer value in octal notation.<br/>
	 * "x" or "X": Integer in hexadecimal notation with either lower or upper case letters.<br/>
	 * "e": Floating point value with exponent like 1.2e7 .<br/>
	 * "f": Floating point value of desires precision.<br/>
	 * "g": Behaves like "e" if exponent of value is -4 or greater otherwise behaves like "f".<br/>
	 *      Removes trailing "0" on decimal side.<br/>
	 * "c": Integer value converted to character (0-127).<br/>
	 * "s": String value.<br/>
	 * 
	 * Examples:<br/>
	 * "{}": Use the next parameter from \em parameters and format it as string.<br/>
	 * "{2}": Always use third parameter from \em parameters.<br/>
	 * "{:.2f}": Use next parameter from \em parameters and format it as floating point value
	 *           with 2 digits after the period.<br/>
	 * "{1:.2f}": Same as above but always use second parameter from \em parameters.<br/>
	 * "{:04d}": Use next parameter from \em parameters and format it as integer value padded
	 *           up to 4 digits with "0".<br/>
	 * "{:s}": Use next parameter from \em parameters and format it as string. This calls
	 *         Object.toString() on the parameter. This is the same as "{}".<br/>
