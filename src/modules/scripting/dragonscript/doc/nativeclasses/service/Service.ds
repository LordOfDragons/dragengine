 * \brief Service.
 * \version 1.23
 * 
 * Services provide various platform or community functionality not handled by other modules.
 * Such services are typically queried infrequently and take a certain time time complete.
 * For this reason service request are asynchronous. Data is carried in a generic
 * deServiceObject object. Users have to know the interface of the service. There is no
 * support to query interface structure unless a service desires to provide these using
 * a special service query.
 * 
 * Each service has a unique name across the entire game engine instance. If the name of
 * services of different service modules collide it is undefined which service the user
 * receives.
 * 
 * This is a native class.
