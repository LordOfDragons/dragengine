/**
 * \brief Component collider.
 * 
 * Extended version of ColliderRig. Rig is taken from a component. The component is updated
 * by the physics module during simulation. States can be copied from and to the component.
 * This class is the most simple solution for dealing with physics simulation and collision
 * detection. Just set the component of your scenery element and it works.
 * 
 * \par Bones
 * 
 * The position and orientation of collider bones is located at the center mass point not the
 * rig bone origin in world space. If you use collider bone position or matrix you have to
 * subtract the Rig.boneGetCentralMassPoint(int) for the respective bone to obtain the world
 * position of the rig bone as used by animations.
 * 
 * This is a native class.
