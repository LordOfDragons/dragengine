/**
 * \brief Bezier-3D curve element class property for use with XML loading.
 * 
 * Curve is stored as CurveBezier3D instance. Curves are defined in XML element classes using
 * a list of points. Each point is a list of vectors. If one vector is specified a sharp point
 * is created with the handles and point set to the same vector. If three vectors are specified
 * a point is created with the first vector as point, the second vector as first handle and the
 * third vector as second handle. An example curve definition looks like this:
 * 
 * \code{xml}
 * <list name='propertyName'>
 *   <!-- first curve point as a sharp point -->
 *   <list>
 *     <vector x='0' y='0' z='0'/> <!-- point, handle1 and handle2 -->
 *   </list>
 *   
 *   <!-- second curve point as a regular point with handles -->
 *   <list>
 *     <vector x='2' y='3' z='1'/> <!-- point -->
 *     <vector x='1.5' y='3' z='0.5'/> <!-- handle1 -->
 *     <vector x='2.5' y='3' z='-0.5'/> <!-- handl2 -->
 *   </list>
 * </list>
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Curve points do not support being defined in StubWithProperties.
