/**
 * \brief Interface for behaviors requiring post initialization.
 * \version 1.26
 * 
 * Behaviors with this interface have to register themselves during \ref ECBehaviorInstance#init()
 * using \ref BehaviorElement#registerPostInit() to get their \ref #postInit() called after
 * \ref ECBehaviorInstance#init() of all behaviors have been called called. This allows behaviors
 * to apply special initilization logic which has to be delayed until all behaviors have initialized.
