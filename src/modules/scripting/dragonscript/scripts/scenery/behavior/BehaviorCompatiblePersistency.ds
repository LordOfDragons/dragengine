/**
 * \brief Interface for behaviors supporting compatible persistency.
 * \version 1.5
 * 
 * Compatible persistency behaviors allow BehaviorElement to persist behavior instances in a
 * backwards and future expansion compatible way. Such behaviors needs to provide a unique
 * behavior identifier saved together with the behavior instance data. While loading the
 * behavior data is matched by using this behavior identifier.
 * 
 * Furthermore if a behavior data block does not match any behavior all behaviors are asked
 * if they know how to load the behavior data block although not belonging to them. This is
 * required if a user replaces a behavior with another behavior providing the same but
 * enhanced behavior. Typically these behaviors are subclass of the replaced behavior.
 * They can be written to support reading the behavior data block of the super class they
 * enhance to avoid breaking save files if possible.
