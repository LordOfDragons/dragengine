/**
 * \brief Physics element.
 * 
 * Physics behavior element composing of these behaviors:
 * - ECBehaviorComponent
 * - ECBehaviorCollider
 * - ECBehaviorAttachToParent
 * 
 * This class is a quick way to add physics elements to a game world. Such elements use
 * CollisionResponse.dynamic and are affected by physical simulation. You can create new
 * element classes by subclassing and adding additional behaviors. It is usually though
 * better to create a new BehaviorElementClass subclass instead adding the desired
 * behaviors. This also allows to use subclassed behaviors for specific needs.
 * 
 * The default collision filter makes the physics element being affected by
 * BaseGameApp.CollisionFilterBit.actor but not BaseGameApp.CollisionFilterBit.actorAI .
 * This is on purpose. If BaseGameApp.CollisionFilterBit.actorAI is used then the actor
 * will stop moving when it touches the physics element. This prevents the actor from
 * pushing the physics element. Instead by using BaseGameApp.CollisionFilterBit.actor
 * the actor AI collider is moving through the physics element as if it is not present.
 * The regular collider present in the actor can then be used to assign a shape which
 * affects the physics element.
