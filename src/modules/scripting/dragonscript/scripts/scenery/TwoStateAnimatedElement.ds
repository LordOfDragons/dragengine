/**
 * \brief Two state animated element
 * 
 * Two state animated element extends SimpleElementClass with support to play back animations
 * for elements in two different states with transition between them. The used animator is
 * required to have 4 controllers set up in a specific way to function with this element class.
 * 
 * - "deactivated": Controller used while the behavior is in deactivated state.
 *                  This is typically an unclamped controller. If missing behavior does
 *                  not think consuming no processing time.
 * - "activated": Controller used while the behavior is in activated state.
 *                This is typically an unclamped controller. If missing behavior does
 *                not think consuming no processing time.
 * - "activating": Controller used while behavior is transitioning from deactivated state
 *                 to activated state. The transition ends when the controller reaches
 *                 the upper limit. For this reason the controller has to be a clamped
 *                 controller otherwise the transition never ends. If missing behavior
 *                 transitions immediately to activated state.

 * \par Activate Trigger
 * 
 * When changing to true the element is switched to the activated state. When changing to
 * false the element is switched to the deactivated state. If the switch happens during
 * transition time the transition is finished before switching.
