/**
 * \brief Interface for VR trigger interaction support with base actor actions.
 * \version 1.12
 * 
 * Implementing actions provide touch, untouch, pull, release and analog actions.
 * 
 * The touch, untouch, pull and release actions are binary actions. If the VR controller
 * supports analog trigger input the pull and release actions are triggered if a controller
 * defined threshold value is reached. Not all controllers support touch and untouch.
 * 
 * The analog trigger action is a gradual value in the range from 0 (released) to 1 (pulled).
 * Not all VR controllers support analog trigger input. If not supported the value is always 0.
