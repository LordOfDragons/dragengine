/**
 * \brief Interface for VR grab object support with base actor actions.
 * \version 1.10
 * 
 * Implementing actions provide a grab and release action as well as an analog grab and
 * squeeze action.
 * 
 * The grab and release are binary actions. If the VR controller supports analog grab
 * input the grab and release actions are triggered if a controller defined threshold
 * value is reached.
 * 
 * The analog grab action is a gradual value in the range from 0 (ungrabbed) to 1 (grabbed).
 * Not all VR controllers support analog grab input. If not supported the value is always 0.
 * 
 * The squeeze action is a gradual value in the range from 0 (no force applied) to 1
 * (maximum supported force applied). Not all VR controller support squeeze input.
 * If not supported the value is always 0.
