/**
 * \brief Base actor action for use with ECBehaviorActorCutscene.
 * 
 * While activate no update are allowed potentially interfering with cutscene handling.
 * Optionally a BaseActorAction can be set to be activated if cutscene is stopped.
 * This allows to play a single cutscene automatically reverting to another action once
 * finished. This only checks if the cutscene is in stopped state at element thinking time.
 * By using this mode you have to start the cutscene before the action has the chance to
 * think or it will immediately switch to the next action. By default no action is set and
 * the BAACutscene action waits until manually switched to anoterh one. This mode of operation
 * is recommended since it is the best to control.
