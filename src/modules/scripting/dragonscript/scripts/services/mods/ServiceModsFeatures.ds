	 * up/down type widget is used to represent 'positive' and 'negative' ratings. For a
	 * rating count of 3 a thumbs up/down/neutral type widget is used to represent
	 * 'positive', 'negative' and 'neutral' ratings. For higher rating counts either
	 * a star or bar type widget is used. The count of shown stars is one less than the
	 * rating count. Hence a rating count of 5 shows 4 stars which can be all disabled
	 * which is the rating 0.
