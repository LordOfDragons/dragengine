/**
 * \brief Global events.
 * 
 * Provides support to register events on a global level and add listeners to them. This can be
 * used to add global game events without needing to set up customized listeners for each event.
 * 
 * Global events use a common listener interface with one single method. Optionally code blocks
 * can be assigned as listeners which avoids the need to implement the listener interface.
 * In general though it is recommended to use the interface instead of the block.
 * 
 * Global events are generic by nature. The senders and listeners have to know what optional
 * data can be send along an event as well as who the source might be.
