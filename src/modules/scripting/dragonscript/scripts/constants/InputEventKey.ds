/**
 * \brief InputEvent key codes.
 * 
 * Identify keyboard keys without matching particular OS or hardware. This is used in
 * situations like UI where keyboard input has to be used without the user assinging
 * first a binding to input device buttons. Multiple keys can return the same key code.
 * For example keypad number or arrow keys return the same code as regular number and
 * arrow keys. Game scripts should use key character or button ID using bindings to
 * listen to specific keys on a keyboard if possible.
 * 
 * Key codes are provided for InputEventType.keyPress and InputEventType.keyRelease only.
