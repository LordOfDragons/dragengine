/**
 * \brief Convenience enumeration for face expressions.
 * \version 1.12
 * 
 * See https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenXR/specs/1.0/html/xrspec.html#XR_HTC_facial_tracking
 * and https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenXR/specs/1.0/html/xrspec.html#XR_FB_face_tracking2
 * for description and images of face expressions. Expressions existing in one expression set
 * are emulated in the other if possible.
 * 
 * Some expressions are simplified expressions. These can have detail expressions which combined
 * match up with the simplified expression. Use only the simplified expression or the corresponding
 * detail expressions or you get the expression applied twice. You can also apply simplified
 * expressions last and make them overwrite detail expressions. In this case both systems can
 * work together if it is unclear which system is used.
 * 
 * Expressions up to and including \ref InputDeviceFaceExpression#tongueMorphDownLeft
 * are present since version 1.12 . All other expressions are present since version 1.21 .
