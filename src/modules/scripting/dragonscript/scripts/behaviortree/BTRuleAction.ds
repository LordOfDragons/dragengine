/**
 * \brief Behavior tree rule running an action.
 * 
 * This is the main working rule connecting game logic to the behavior tree. BTAction subclasses
 * are created by the game developer and added to the behavior tree. If the rule is run the
 * action is looked up and run. The return value of the action becomes the return value of the
 * rule.
 * 
 * For performance reasons the action is looked up once then stored in the rule. This is
 * correct behavior as long as the rules are not changed at run-time. If you need changing
 * actions at run-time implement a BTAction forwarding to the desired BTAction. This way the
 * cached action stays valid while the actual BTAction called inside can change. This is though
 * an elaborate situation. Usually actions are added to the behavior tree once and then never
 * change.
