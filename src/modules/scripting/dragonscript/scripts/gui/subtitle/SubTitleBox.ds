/**
 * \brief Displays list of sub titles.
 * 
 * By default texts are stacked from newest to oldest. The text vanish after their hide timer
 * elapses. Optionally the SubTitleBox can be set to remove all texts before adding a new one.
 * This turns the SubTitleBox into an RPG like text box where each new text replaces existing
 * one if present.
 * 
 * The default layout is CentrizedBoxLayout using Y_AXIS_NEG. This displays each block of text
 * with as much width as required but at most the entire width in which case text blocks
 * wrap around using multiple lines. To get all blocks spanning the entire width use FlowLayout.
