/**
 * @brief Styled Text.
 * Provides support for styled text. The text is defined similar to HTML
 * using a box model. Instead of using HTML though a small subset thereof
 * is used in a slightly changed way as the comlexity is not needed. The
 * root of the text is one node which is usually a container node but can
 * be anything. The nodes build up as a tree structure of child nodes.
 * Styles are defined globally and applied to nodes. In contrary to HTML
 * styles can not be inlined to remove complexity. This class is used
 * only to define the text. To render a styled text use the
 * dedsStyledTextRenderer class.
