The combines directory is used for groups of modules matching the same target.
For example certain 3D model file formats tend to contain model, rig and animation
resources in one file. This requires a Model Module, Rig Module and Animation Module
since the same file extension can be loaded in different ways. To improve the
readability in this case such modules are placed under the "combined" directory
instead of one copy into each module directory they provide.
