/**
 * @brief Unstuck Helper.
 * Provides support to free moving colliders from a stuck position. For this
 * a list of all colliders touching the stuck collider is stored together
 * with the collision parameters in the stuck situation. Using this information
 * an unstuck direction is calculated along which the collider can be pushed
 * to get out of the stuck position. If possible the direction is tried to
 * be perpendicular to the moving direction as this results in the least
 * noticeable movement.
