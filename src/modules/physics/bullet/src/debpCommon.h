// HACK
// this is a temporary solution since bullet uses with btScalar double
// all over the place but inside meshes this is overkill since meshes
// have vertices grouped around their position in the world. Only the
// world position is requried to be double. Doing so also for the mesh
// vertices wastes precious memory. For the time being the btScalar is
// used which works but wastes memory.


// Vertex struct for triangle meshes
struct debpVertex{
	btScalar x;
	btScalar y;
	btScalar z;
};

// Face struct for triangle meshes
struct debpTriangle{
	int p1;
	int p2;
	int p3;
