/*
// this is disabled because debpOverlapFilterCallback is already doing the same filtering.
// nobody else than btCollisionPairCallback::processOverlap in btCollisionDispatcher.cpp
// does use btCollisionDispatcher::needsCollision. this allows us to do the filtering only
// inside the broadphase and avoid doing it in the narrow phase.
// 
// WARNING
// this change has a dangerous side-effect. if collision filter or ignored collision objects
// are changed they will not have effect until the overlapping pair is removed. this can
// result in strange problems where objects keep on colliding although the changed collision
// parameters should prevent them from from colliding. colliders should best remove the rigid
// bodies from the dynamic world and re-add them to trigger a broadphase update.
