 * \brief Delayed operations for world objects.
 * 
 * During collision testing and processing objects can be added to world, removed from
 * the world or changed in a way bullet can not deal with. For example removing objects
 * while bullet is internally looping over the world can result in segmentation faults
 * or other problems. If such a problematic call is conducted the world is put into a
 * locked state where potentially dangerous changes have to be registered to be applied
 * once the locked state is left. The user is responsible to check if the world is
 * currently locked (state stored in this class) and thus operations have to be put
 * into the delayed operations instead. The world locks and unlocks the delayed operation
 * object. Locks are cummulative so only after all locks are released the pending
 * operations are applied.
