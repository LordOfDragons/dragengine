/**
 * @brief Bullet Physics Skin Peer
 * The peer for skin resources in the ODE Physics Module. The main
 * purpose of this class is to provide an octree of faces for quick
 * collision detection if the skin is a simple skin. Complex skins
 * have to be stored inside the Component Peer. Simple skins are
 * much quicker as they do not change over time. A skin is considered
 * simple if it has no weights that could influence the vertices.
