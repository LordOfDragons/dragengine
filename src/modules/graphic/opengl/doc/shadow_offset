Using a mixture here.

glPolygonOffset is used with 0 bias to apply scaling. This works better in the hardware
and is well defined.

Bias is applied in the vertex shader. This works better since in hardware the bias is
not well defined and can be anything the driver likes.

For sky shadows fragment shader is used since double-sided rendering is used with one
set of offset parameters for the front and back face. It would be possible to use inNormal
to replace this. The simple approach would be to look at the inNormal.z value. A value of
0 is full offset while a value of abs(1) is 0 offset (according to scaling). Right now
this is not used.
