/**
 * @brief Generic Double-Precision Octree Class.
 * Provides the generic implementation of an octree algorithm. For real usage subclass
 * this class and implement the required functions. Every Octree object is the root of
 * an octree. The top most octree object with no parent is the real octree root and
 * all children virtual octree roots. The subclass overwrites the node creation function
 * to create nodes of its own class. Furthermore the subclass has to implement the
 * management of the node content. This octree class only provides the skeleton required
 * for an octree algorithm and does not implement any node content logic.

	 * Specified the constants used for the octants. There exists two equal
	 * versions suitable for different types of implementations. The first
	 * set of octant definitions is classified using the axis coordinates.
	 * They are also aligned in a way that the definition value represents
	 * a bit mask. The first bit is the x axis, the second the y axis and
	 * the third the z axis. A set bit indicates positive direction and a
	 * 0 negative direction. This set is useful for implementations working
	 * with bit masks to identify octants. The second set of octant definitions
	 * uses verbal descriptions of the octants and is useful for implementations
	 * based around the logic location of an octant. Both sets include also
	 * a definition for a null octant. This is used by functions searching
	 * for octants to indicate that no matching octant could be found.
