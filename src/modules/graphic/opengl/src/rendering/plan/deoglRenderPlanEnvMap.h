/**
 * Render Plan Environment Map.
 * An environment map used in a render plan to render reflections with. The environment map
 * can be NULL since the render plan uses a fixed size list of environment maps. Additional
 * parameters are stored to allow fading in and out environment maps over time to easy the
 * transition. This state is stored in this object instead of the environment map itself
 * since the same environment map can be used by multiple render plans. Setting and clearing
 * the environment map adds or removes a plan usage from the respective environment map.
