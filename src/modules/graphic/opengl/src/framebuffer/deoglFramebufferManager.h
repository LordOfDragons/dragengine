 * @brief Framebuffer manager.

 * or reusing framebuffers to keep one framebuffer for each resolution
 * asked for. This avoids slowdown due to changing the resolution of
 * framebuffer attachments. On some systems the opposite is true though.
 * If the use only one FBO flag is set only one FBO is created and handed
