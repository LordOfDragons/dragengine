/**
 * Shader loading timeout. Simplifies tracking timeout for loading shaders.
 * 
 * Top level object creates timeout on stack and hands down the reference.
 * 
 * The lowest level shader loading code has to first call CanLoad() to check if the
 * timeout elapsed. This function returns true if either this is the first shader to
 * be loaded or the timeout has not elapsed. This ensures at least one shader is
 * loaded without the timeout being checked.
 * 
 * After loading the shader the lowest level shader loading code has to call Loaded().
 * This clears the first flag. At this point TimedOut() still returns true. This
 * ensures loading one shader can not cause a timeout to be noticed up the call chain.
 * If this is not done functions up the call chain can potentially exit and another
 * try is done at creating shaders.
 * 
 * If later a lowest level shader loader calls CanLoad() and the timeout has elapsed
 * the TimedOut() function will return true. This way a timeout is noticed after
 * the first shader loading that has been prevented due to the timeout after at least
 * one shader has been loaded. This ensure loading never can stall because at least
 * one shader is loaded and no timeout is noticed then.
