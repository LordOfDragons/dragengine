		" Mip mapping averages normals at the distance turning smooth but bumpy surfaces"
		" into near-like mirrors."
		" Furthermore this results in shimmering artifacts while moving the camera."
		" The variance lost in the mip map process has be applied to the roughness to"
		" compensate for the lost bumpiness."
		" This works since roughness is a micro-scale bumpiness of a surface while normals"
		" are macro-scale bumpiness."
		" Values are in the range from 0 to 1 where 0 indicating the percentage of lost"
		" normal variance applied to the roughness."
		" Too low values cause shimmering on bumpy but otherwise smooth surfaces."
		" Too high values cause surfaces to turn dull too strong."
		" The default value is 0.75."
		" This applies roughly 75% of normal variance to the roughness."
		" This accounts for interreflections happening reducing the correction at the distance a bit."
		" Values between 50-100% are reasonable." );
