		" Using edge coverage the found results near the screen edge are gradually faded out"
		" to avoid sharp differences between reflections just inside or outside the screen boundaries."
		" This parameter sets the power to which the edge coverage is raised."
		" The default is 2 which results in a quadratic fading from no coverage to full coverage."
		" A value of 1 results in a linear fading from no coverage to full coverage."
		" Values larger than 2 result in fading function using x-raisedto-N keeping the coverage longer"
		" near full coverage before falling down to no coverage."
