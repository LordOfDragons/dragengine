/**
 * Occlusion Test Listener.
 * Listener for occlusion testing called during evaluation of test results. This listener might
 * look strange as it contains only one function. This is due to speed reasons. Occlusion testing
 * is used to flag elements as invisible. Hence elements are considered visible unless proven
 * otherwise. This allows to avoid a bunch of function calls. While starting an occlusion test
 * the element sets itself visible. This lines up with the case of no occlusion testing done to
 * begin with. In this situation we are only interested in a notification if the element is
 * found to be invisible. Sending a notification if the element is found to be visible is a waste
 * of time. Hence only one function exists.
