/**
 * @brief Preload OpenGL objects.
 * This class supports preloading various objects so they can be used for rendering. This includes
 * objects which have to be prepared before the first rendering takes place to avoid stalling the
 * gpu driver. This is different from rendering specific preparation routines which can be done
 * during rendering without stalling the gpu driver. One type of objects included in this class
 * are resources created during the frame update loop. The opengl objects linked to these resources
 * can not be created safely and efficiently outside the frame rendering call. Hence the creation
 * of opengl objects is delayed until right before rendering as then the opengl context is in a
 * safe state and creation calls do not stall the gpu driver.
