/**
 * @brief Environment Map Slot Manager.
 * Manages a list of environment map slots. Slots can be empty or referencing an environment map using
 * a last used counter. A fixed number of slots is managed with the possibility to enlarge if required.
 * New environment maps are assigned a slot if not in the list already and their last use is reset to 0.
 * After use the last used counter is increased of all slots. If all slots are full the empty slot not
 * used the since the most number of frames is assigned the environment map. If an environment map is
 * assigned to a slot the environment map texture is copied to the array texture of the matching layer.
 * As a result the array texture contains the active environment maps with the least amount of texture
 * copying required. In addition a list of indices to all the non-empty slots is stored easy to be used
 * for rendering later on.
