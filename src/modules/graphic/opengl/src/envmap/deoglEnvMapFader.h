/**
 * @brief Environment Map Fader
 * Provides support to fade between environment maps while they change. Two environment maps are
 * stored at most each time. The first environment map is the active one. If a different environment
 * map is set it is taken as the fading one. The fading is done over time. Once the fading
 * environment map reached full strength it is set as the active one and the fading one set to NULL.
 * Fading is not started before the previous fading has finished. This guarantees no popping but it
 * can lead to a longer usage of an environment map if moving too fast. The fading speed can be
 * adjusted to provide a smoother fading if moving slow and quicker fading if moving fast.
