/**
 * OpenGL Space Partition Tree.
 * Provides a data structure to partition space into cubes of variable
 * size including connectivity data. For speed and memory reasons the
 * space partition tree is organized in a grid fashion on the base
 * level. The grid is of equal size in all directions providing for
 * fast locating cubes given a position or a collision volume as well
 * as providing a good basic partition of space. Each cube is set to
 * NULL if it is empty space reducing memory consumption to a minimum.
 * Nodes containing a shift from empty space to solid space are filled
 * with a space partition tree node object which is the root of a k-Tree
 * breaking space down more fine grained where required.
