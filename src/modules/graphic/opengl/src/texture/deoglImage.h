/**
 * Image Peer.
 * 
 * Images can be used by two different types of parties.
 * 
 * The first use is by entities requiring the image data to be present as deoglRImage texture.
 * For these parties the deoglRImage texture is always created.
 * 
 * The second type of entities require only the pixel buffer data to do some processing work.
 * These entities have to call CreatePixelBuffer() to add a use to the pixel buffer. If the
 * pixel buffer is not present yet image data is retained and released if required and the
 * pixel buffer created. Afterwards the use count is incremented by one. Once the pixel buffer
 * is not required anymore ReleasePixelBuffer() has to be called and the use count is
 * decremented by one. If the use count drops to 0 the pixel buffer is released.
 * 
 * For the first usage type an own pixel buffer different from the second use case is created.
 * This is required since this pixel buffer is handed over to deoglRImage which in turn owns
 * now the pixel buffer.
