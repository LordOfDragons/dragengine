 * Render video.
 * 
 * Stores cached frames if the video is small enough to warrant keeping it
 * in memory. Video player peers are responsible to store cached frames
 * during synchronization time. During rendering time the cached frames
 * can be accessed.
 * 
 * Only one video player can upload a new cached texture. If a cached
 * texture is set all other video players have to skip storing another
 * cached texture. This allows to keep the storing procedure simple while
 * being a little bit less optimal. The chance of multiple video players
 * to randomly access the same video file is small. In the case they still
 * do the video is preloaded by one video player in short time anyways.
