/**
 * @brief Depth Triangle List.
 *
 * Stores a list of depth triangles. The triangles are stored only with
 * there position and no texture information. Useful for shadow casting
 * algorithms which require a list of triangles potentially requiring
 * to split them. A split method is provided for adding a triangle using
 * the maximum edge length as split criteria. The triangles are kept in
 * a continuous list of vertiex-tripples so they can be copied directly
 * into a VBO if required. The winding of the triangles matches the
 * opengl triangle orientation.
