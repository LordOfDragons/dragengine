/**
 * \brief Input device axis.
 * 
 * Axes can be any input control a user can alter between a minimum and maximum range.
 * Axes are always a single value. Input elements moving along more than 1 degree of
 * freedom one individual axis is used for each degree of freedom. A mouse has 2 axes
 * one for X movement and one for Y movement. The same applies to an analog stick on
 * a joystick or gamepad. A 3D mouse or joystick with twist support use 3 axes. Complex
 * input controls like racing wheels can have more than 3 axes.
 * 
 * Dead zone and jitter is handled by the input module. The scripting module does not
 * have to worry about this. The input module adjusts the values to hide these parameters.
 * For example for a gamepad the input value is mapped from the range
 * (realMinimum -> deadZone) to (-1, 0) and (deadZone -> realMaximum) to (0, 1). The
 * entire dead zone shows up as 0 value to the scripting module no matter how the user
 * configurated the dead zone.
 * 
 * The minimum, center and maximum values are fixed to -1, 0 and 1. The input module maps
 * the axis range to this value range to simplify the use for script modules. The input
 * handling used by scripts has to matcht the way axes work. A stick matches the -1 to 1
 * range with 0 value if the stick is not touched. A throttle control on the other hand
 * can have the center position at the minimum position. In this case the game script
 * has to map -1 to 0 to get the correct result. The user is responsible to assign the
 * matching input axes to the appropriate game bindings. The game can use the device
 * type to locate potential problems due to misconfiguration. Relative axes work different
 * in that they have no limited range. The returned value is always the last change in
 * position reported which can be larger than 1.
