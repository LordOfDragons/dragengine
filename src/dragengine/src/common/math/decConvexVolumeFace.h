/**
 * \brief Convex Volume Face.
 *
 * Defines the face of a convex volume. Such a face is also convex
 * and defined by an ordered list of vertices and a normal. The
 * vertices are oriented clockwise around the normal. To assist in
 * dealing with convex volume face creation you can add the points
 * in any order and use the SortVertices function to sort the
 * vertices in clockwise order around the normal. Often faces in a
 * convex volume are used to mark interesting locations in space.
 * To prevent having to create subclasses faces for this common task
 * a marker value is included in the default convex volume face class
 * which can be set to an integer value.
