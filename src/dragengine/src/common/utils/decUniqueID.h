/**
 * \brief Unique ID.
 *
 * Unique id useful for identifying objects across the network or on persistent
 * storage. The ID has a variable bit count which has to be a multiple of 8.
 * Therefore you do not have to worry about id overflow or using too many data
 * for few ids. The id can be incremented. This is useful if a counter id is
 * kept that is used to initialize new ids with. Unique ids are stored as an
 * array of bytes. You can retrieve and alter the bytes individually.
