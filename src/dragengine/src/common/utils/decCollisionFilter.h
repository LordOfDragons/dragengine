 * a single bit and the filter one or more bits. In special cases this
 * can be different. Two collision filters collide with each other if
 * A.category.Matches(B.filter) and B.category.Matches(A.filter). For
 * simple layer mask matching without filtering set both category and
 * filter to the same value. Otherwise category is usually set to the
 * object category and the filter to all categories the object is
