/**
 * \brief 2D Curve.
 *
 * Defines a curve in 2 dimensions. The curve is defined using
 * a set of points. Points inserted are sorted using the X
 * coordinate. Points which are identical are merged with the
 * newly added point overwriting the old point. Two evaluation
 * methods are provided to evaluate the curve using either
 * constant or linear interpolation. Using constant
 * interpolation the value of a curve point corresponds to the
 * Y coordinate of the point right prior to it. Linear
 * interpolation slides the Y value gradually between points.
 * For cubic interpolation an additional class is used since
 * this requires storing point parameters for evaluation and
 * doing this for each evaluation of a point is slow.
