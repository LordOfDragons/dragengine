/**
 * \brief Z-Compressed file writer.
 * 
 * Writes data to another file writer using Zlib compression. The user is responsible
 * to place the file writer to the position where the Z-compressed data begins. This
 * allows the user to place arbitrary headers in front of the z-compressed data. The
 * compressed data is always written sequentially hence file writers unable to seek
 * can be used. The z-writer takes over the original writer pointer deleting it once
 * the z-writer itself is destroyed. The typical use case is to create a writer,
 * writing the header, creating the z-writer and then handing back the z-writer to
 * write the compressed file content. This way pointers are handled properly and the
 * z-writer can be transparently used everywhere a file writer is used.
