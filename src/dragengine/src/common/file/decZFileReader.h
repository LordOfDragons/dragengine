/**
 * \brief Z-Compressed file reader.
 * 
 * Reads data from another file writer using Zlib compression. The user is responsible
 * to place the file reader at the position where the Z-compressed data begins. This
 * allows the user to place arbitrary headers in front of the z-compressed data. The
 * compressed data is always read sequentially hence file readers unable to seek
 * can be used. The z-reader takes over the original reader pointer deleting it once
 * the z-reader itself is destroyed. The typical use case is to create a reader,
 * read the header, creating the z-reader and then handing back the z-reader to
 * read the compressed file content. This way pointers are handled properly and the
 * z-reader can be transparently used everywhere a file reader is used.
