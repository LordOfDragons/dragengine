/**
 * \brief Helper for accessing files in a virtual file system cache.
 * 
 * The cache helper organizes files in a cache virtual file directory
 * using a unique string identifier of variable length. The identifer
 * can be any kind of string typically a file path or concatenations
 * of file path and other information. The cache helper stores these
 * files as fN with N starting at 0. The file mapping is kept in memory
 * as a slot list so new files are stored at the next free slot. The
 * files themselves store first a 2-byte length value followed by the
 * identifier followed by the actual cache file content. While opening
 * or saving a file a file reader/writer is returned with the file
 * pointer set to the starting position of the cache content. The user
 * of the cache helper is responsible to write into the cache content
 * any data required to detect outdated cache content. The file mapping
 * is not stored on disk. Each time the helper is created the files in
 * the cache directory are scanned for their identifier and the mapping
 * build from them.
