/**
 * \brief Virtual file system.
 * 
 * Manages a virtual file system. The file system is by default empty and filled with
 * content using container objects. Each container object populates a given directory
 * with content. This process is not the same as file system mounting therefore the
 * content of a container object does not replace the content in the directory but
 * adds to it. Already existing files and directories are shadowed. Therefore the
 * order of the container objects is important. Container objects shadow files and
 * directories defined by container objects located before them.
 * 
 * \warning
 * 
 * VFS containers are thread-safe for all operations. This class is only thread-safe
 * if containers are modified only before using the VFS but not while using it.
 * If you need to change the containers while using the VFS use the deVFSModular
 * container. This container is safe to be modified while in use.
