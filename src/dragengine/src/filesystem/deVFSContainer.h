/**
 * \brief Virtual file system container.
 * 
 * A virtual file system container provides a collection of real or virtuel
 * files. Containers can be queried for a listing of files, the existance
 * of files and to open files for reading and writing. Each container has
 * a path assigned where the root of the container is. All files and
 * directories inside the container are inserted into the virtual file
 * system under this path. The content does not replace the content of the
 * given path as a mount command would do but adds the its own content to
 * the content already existing. Duplicate files are shadowed in this
 * process. The order of containers therefore matters.
 * 
 * Containers can be hidden. Hidden containers do not show up in file
 * listings unless the listing is done from a path inside the container
 * path. This allows to add special containers that should not be easily
 * visible to game scripts unless the path is known.
