/**
 * \brief Synchronization barrier.
 * 
 * Implements barrier type synchronization for multiple threads. In the initial state
 * the barrier is closed with an open threshold larger than 0 blocking all threads
 * trying to get through. Each thread calling Wait() increments the barrier counter
 * and is blocked. Once the counter reaches the threshold the barrier is opened up
 * and all waiting threads woken up to pass through. Once all threads have passed
 * through the barrier automatically closes again to be ready for another round. In
 * addition the barrier can be forcefully opened with Open() even though the threshold
 * has not been reached yet. This behavior has a few implications to keep in mind. If
 * a thread arrives while the barrier is still open and tries to wait it slips through
 * the open barrier without waiting. Reusing a single barrier alone can then lead to
 * unexpected behavior. If a thread passes through and immediately waits again on the
 * barrier for example because it finished so fast the barrier is still open and the
 * thread slips through again getting another turn. To prevent this problem use two
 * barriers alternating between them. Unless forcefully opened at most one of the
 * barriers can be open at each time. This ensures all threads run through a code
 * path exactly once before all are allowed to enter the section again.
