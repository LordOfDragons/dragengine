 * Provides the basic class for all engine objects. Each object has a
 * reference count. Objects stay alive as long as the reference count
 * is larger than 0. If you want to add a reference use the AddReference
 * function. If you want to free the reference you have added before use
 * the FreeReference function and do not call 'delete'. Upon creation
 * each object is assigned a reference count of 1 so you do not have to
 * add a refernece after creating an object.
