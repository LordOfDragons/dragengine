 * \brief Animation Resource.
 * 
 * Animation resources contain the states of bones for animation
 * purpose. The animation resource contains a list of moves which
 * describe the single movement of a riged object. Each move
 * contains a keyframe list for each bone of the animation. Those
 * keyframes contain the state of a bone in a particular point of
 * time. This information can be used by the engine and the game
 * scripts to derive the bone position for an arbitrary point in
 * time. The bones of an animation have to be mapped first to
 * the bones of a rig.
