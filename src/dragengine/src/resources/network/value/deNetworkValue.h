 * \brief Network Value Class.

 * Defines a value in a network state. Network state properties are
 * defined by a name that is unique inside the parent network state.
 * The type indicates what kind of value is stored in the value. A
 * set of typical types is provided which should be enough to represent
 * states across the network. In addtion each network state value
 * has also a predictor assigned. Predictors are used to cut down on
 * the number of packets send over the network by predicting the upcoming
