/**
 * \brief Network Message Class.
 *
 * Manages a network message of variable length. Supports reading and
 * writing to the message providing basic data types. Reading and
 * writing is done like with a file stream with a stream position which
 * is the same for reading and writing as well as end of message
 * functions. An exception is raised if an attempt is made to read past
 * the end of the message. The buffer is increased in size if a write
 * attempt is made past the end of the message. This way the buffer can
 * be filled with data making the message grow to the required size to
 * hold all data. To Read data of a given size the SetLength call can
 * be used to resize the buffer to at last a given length before reading
 * the data into the messagchare.
