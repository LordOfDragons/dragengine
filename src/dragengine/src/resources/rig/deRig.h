/**
 * \brief Rig file resource.
 *
 * Rigs define the sceleton of a static or articulated physics bodies. Animations and
 * components are mapped to a rig for animation. Rigs are also used by the physics
 * system to provide collision detection and physical simulations. For the physics
 * system the root bone is mapped to the component collider. If this bone is missing
 * the simulation produces incorrect behavior.
 * 
 * \par Shapes
 * Shapes define the physical shape of resource and are only used by the physics system.
 * See decShapeList for information about the available shape types. Shapes can be
 * defined for bones as well as the rig as a whole. For static rigs shapes are only
 * placed on the rig itself. For articulated rigs shapes are only placed on bines. Shapes
 * on the entire rig are ignored for articulated rigs.
 * 
 * Shapes can be assigned a single shape property string. This allows to transport some
 * additional game specific information with individual shapes of a rig. A typical use
 * case is modifying the material sound for certain shapes. The user can choose the
 * content and format of the string. By default all shapes have an empty string assigned.
 * 
 * \par Model Collision
 * By default rig and bones use shapes to define the collision volumes. It is possible
 * to use the model of the component (if a deColliderComponent) if present. If model
 * collision is used all shapes for rigs and bones are ignored and the model hull is
 * used as collision volume. This allows for a fine grained and dynamic collision
 * volume but is slower than shape collision and can lead to strange results if model
 * faces intersect due to animation. Non-deformable models provide safer results and
 * and faster than deformable models. If you can always use shapes since they provide
 * the fastest and most stable behavior.
