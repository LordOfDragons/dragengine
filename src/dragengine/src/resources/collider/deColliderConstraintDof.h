/**
 * \brief Collider Constraint Degree of Freedom.
 * 
 * Defines a degree of freedom constraint for a collider. A degree of freedom can be
 * either locked, limited or free depending on the values of the lower and upper
 * limits. If the upper limit is equal to the lower limit the degree of freedom is
 * locked. For performance and stability reason it is best to set as many degrees of
 * freedom to locked as possible. If the upper limit is larger than the lower limit
 * the degree of freedom is limited and is kept between those limits. If the upper
 * limit is lower than the lower limit the degree of freedom is free in which case
 * any movement is valid. A free degree of freedom is second best to locked in terms
 * of performance and stability. To avoid issues with floating point values physics
 * modules are required to use a safe zone of FLOAT_SAFE_EPSYLON between the two
 * limit values before calling a degree of freedom free instead of locked. Hence to
 * mark a degree of freedom as free best practise is to make the upper limit smaller
 * than the lower limit by a good amount. If you want to be safe use the setLocked,
 * setLimited and setFree functions. By default a degree of freedom is locked.
 * 
 * Joints in the real world exhibit friction while moving. This situation is modelled
 * using the static and kinematic friction. The static friction defines the force that
 * is needed to get a join moving in a certain direction. The physical formula is
 * staticFrictionForce = normalForce * staticFrictionCoefficient. Calculating normalForce
 * for a join is usually difficult so the the static friction force is used instead.
 * This is simple to retrieve from real world objects by measuring the force required
 * to get an object moving. While moving the kinematic friction is used. This is again
 * physically defined as kinematicFriction = normalForce * kinematicFrictionCoefficient.
 * Here too the normalForce is a problem. For this reason the force acting on the joint
 * is used instead. This allows to use the kinematicFrictionCoefficient as kinematic
 * friction. Hence the static friction is the force neede to get a joint moving and
 * the kinematic friction the percentage of the applying force absorbed by the inner
 * friction. Once the movement force drops below the static friction force the movement
 * grinds to a halt again.
 * 
 * In addition a degree of freedom can be turned into a spring. A degree of freedom
 * can be limited or free while being a spring or not. The spring is defined using
 * the constants found in Hooke's Law therefore F=-k*x . The stiffness spring constant
 * equals to the k constant defining the percentage of the distance stretched away
 * from the equilibrium position applied as force. Hence k is given as [N/m]. The
 * spring damping determines the amount of energy lost over time. A stiffness of 0
 * disables spring behavior.
