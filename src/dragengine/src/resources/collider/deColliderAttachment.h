/**
 * \brief Attach resources to a collider.
 * 
 * Stores information about a resource attached to a a collider.
 * The following resource types can be attached:
 * - deResourceManager::ertBillboard
 * - deResourceManager::ertCamera
 * - deResourceManager::ertCollider
 * - deResourceManager::ertComponent
 * - deResourceManager::ertDebugDrawer
 * - deResourceManager::ertEnvMapProbe
 * - deResourceManager::ertForceField
 * - deResourceManager::ertLight
 * - deResourceManager::ertLumimeter
 * - deResourceManager::ertMicrophone
 * - deResourceManager::ertNavigationSpace
 * - deResourceManager::ertParticleEmitterInstance
 * - deResourceManager::ertPropField
 * - deResourceManager::ertSpeaker
 * - deResourceManager::ertTouchSensor
 * 
 * All other resource types will generate an exception if attempted to be attached.
 * Resources can be attached using different modes. Not all of them are supported
 * for all resource types. See deColliderAttachment::aAttachType for details.
 * 
 * In the case of attached collider resource of type component or rig a source bone
 * can be specified. If such a bone is defined it is used to attach the collider
 * instead of the collider origin itself. For all other resource types this is not used.
