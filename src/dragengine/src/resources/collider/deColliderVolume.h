 * \brief Volume collider.

 * Colliders are used by the physics module to provide collision
 * detection and optional collision response. After the collision
 * detection stage is done each Collider contains the new state
 * of motion. The user can then update the game state depending
 * on the changes. The scripting peer receives all relevant events
 * during a collision detection run. The Collider is defined by a
 * list of Collision Volume objects. The final test volume is
 * considered to be the boolean union of all the volumes.
