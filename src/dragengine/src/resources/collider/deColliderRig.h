 * \brief Rig collider.
 *
 * Colliders are used by the physics module to provide collision
 * detection and optional collision response. After the collision
 * detection stage is done each Collider contains the new state
 * of motion. The user can then update the game state depending
 * on the changes. The scripting peer receives all relevant events
 * during a collision detection run. The Collider is defined by a
 * Rig object. The Rig object contains a list of bones. Each bone
 * is defined by a Collision Volume and additional physical
 * properties. Each bone is considered to be one single collision
 * body able to collide with all other bones in the rig except the
 * direct parent bone.
