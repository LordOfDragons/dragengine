 * \brief Component collider.

 * Colliders are used by the physics module to provide collision
 * detection and optional collision response. After the collision
 * detection stage is done each Collider contains the new state
 * of motion. The user can then update the game state depending
 * on the changes. The scripting peer receives all relevant events
 * during a collision detection run. The Collider is defined by a
 * Component object. The Component object contains a Model and a
 * Rig object. The Rig object defines the bones and the physical
 * properties but the collision volumes are ignored. Instead the
 * triangle mesh stored in the Model is used as collision volume.
 * Optional a Collision Model object can be assigned to be used
 * instead of the Model object providing more a optimized
 * collision volume.
