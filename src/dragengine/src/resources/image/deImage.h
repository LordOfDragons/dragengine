/**
 * \brief Image resource.
 * 
 * Image resources are retrieved from the deImageManager bei either loading an image from file
 * or creating a new one. Images loaded from file are treated read-only while created images
 * can be read or write.
 * 
 * If the image is loaded from a file the peers are asked if they need the image data to be
 * retained. If nobody needs the image data retained it is release to reduce memory consumption,
 * which is important on some platforms.
 * 
 * If the peers or any other party needs the image data back in memory it can be retained by
 * calling RetainImageData(). If the image data is no more required ReleaseImageData() has
 * to be called. Whenever nobody needs the image data anymore it is released from memory.
 * 
 * All image parameters except the image data itself can be always accessed safely. Due to the
 * retaining ability the image data itself (all GetData*() calls) can only be accessed when
 * the caller called RetainImageData() earlier. Otherwise GetData*() can return NULL if the
 * image data is currently not retained.
 * 
 * Calling RetainImageData() and ReleaseImageData() uses mutex locking internally to avoid
 * race conditions. Modifications of image data is only allowed by the game scripts during
 * main thread frame updating of the respective scripting module. For accessing the data no
 * locking is required since GetData() is only valid after RetainImageData() finished.
