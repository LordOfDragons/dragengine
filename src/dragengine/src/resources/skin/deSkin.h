/**
 * \brief Skin with textures.
 *
 * Skins contain the textures for scene components. A skin is a collection
 * of textures. Each texture is named and composes of properties. Components
 * link to textures using their name. Properties describe where the data for
 * various types originate from.
 *
 * \par Renderables
 * Renderables are the most powerfull building stones of a texture. Such a
 * renderable can be changed during runtime at any time. What data you
 * place inside such a renderable is up to the developer. To use renderables
 * you reference them using their name from inside your code. Renderables
 * can be shared which is why they are stored outside the data trees.
