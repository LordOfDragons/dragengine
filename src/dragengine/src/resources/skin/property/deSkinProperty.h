/**
 * \brief Skin Texture Property.
 *
 * Defines a property of a skin texture. To allow adding any kind of new
 * material properties without changing the engine code or other modules
 * a simple name based system is used. Depending on the name of a property
 * graphic modules can apply the property to different material properties
 * internally.
 * 
 * \par
 * A property is defined as mentioned by a name. To avoid storing a
 * large number of names only a number is used to determine the type of
 * a texture property. To obtain this number add the name of the property
 * to the deTexturePropertyMap object obtainable from the game engine.
 * 
 * \par
 * Properties can have different types of values depending on their
 * usage. Simple properties contain a static color or an entire static
 * image. Using a color instead of an image is allowed and equals to an
 * image composing of only this color. The other way is not allowed and
 * results in undefined behavior. The static color and image can be used
 * both either as gray-scale ( in which case only the red component is
 * used ), rgb ( in which case the red, green and blue component are used )
 * or rgba ( in which case all components are used ). Hence it's possible
 * to define up to four parameters for one property.
 * 
 * \par
 * There exists a special case and this are renderables. If a property
 * has a renderable name set its content can be changed dynamically during
 * runtime using renderables in components. This is not considered dynamic
 * since the content is provided by the game script and not produced on
 * the fly.
 * 
 * \par
 * For dynamic skins there exist the way to specify a source as the
 * value of a property. Such a sure describes the production process of
 * a dynamic texture. Dynamic skins tend to be slower and consuming more
 * resources than static skins composed of simple properties only. Using
 * a transformation on the texture itself does not make a texture complex
 * and is fast.
 * 
 * \par
 * Properties can be interprated by one or more modules. So far the
 * graphic, audio and physics module can use texture properties.
 * 
 * \par
 * In addition a bone name can be set. This is used by texture properties using vertex position
 * instead of texture coordinates as input. The vertex position is evaluated relative to the
 * bone coordinate system. Texture properties not using vertex position ignore this parameter.
