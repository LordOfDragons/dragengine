 * \brief Skin texture video property.

 * Uses frames of a video as texture. The video is automatically played back
 * by the Graphic Module. By default the playback time is shared across all
 * instances this property is used in. This ensures all instances fit together
 * if used next to each other no matter when the user of the skin has been
 * added to the world. For certain use cases though like special effects it
 * is possible to use unique playback time for each instance.
