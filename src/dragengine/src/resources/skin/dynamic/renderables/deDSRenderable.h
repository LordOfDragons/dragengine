 * \brief Dynamic Skin Renderable.
 *
 * Renderables are dynamic texture images the developer can write to
 * during runtime. A renderable can define a texture using various
 * methods to allow for large flexibility. Most of the types stem
 * directly from Skin Resources. For all types the same rules apply
 * as the target Skin Property. For all other cases where this
 * renderable is has not a Skin Property as target the rules of the
 * destination object apply. Renderables have an optional name useful
 * to attach multiple renderables to one target object.
