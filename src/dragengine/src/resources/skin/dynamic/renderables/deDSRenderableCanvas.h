/**
 * \brief Dynamic skin renderable canvas.
 *
 * The texture is defined using the content of a temporary render target.
 * Temporary render targets are not created by the user but by the Graphic
 * Module on the fly if required and for as long as it is required. The
 * user only specifies the content using a deCanvasView. This allows the
 * Graphic Module to use GPU memory efficiently. In general the size of
 * the canvas view defines the size of the used render target but the
 * Graphic Module is free to choose a fitting size itself.
