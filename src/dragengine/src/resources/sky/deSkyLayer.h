/**
 * \brief Sky Layer.
 *
 * Sky layers define the content of the sky using one or more layers drawn
 * ontop of each other. Each layer can be rotated individually. This way
 * rich skies can be modeled using a simple system. The color parameter can
 * be used to tint the content of a layer. The type of the sky is defined
 * by the assigned skin. This way sky rendering can be enhanced without
 * modifying the engine just the graphic module. The following types are
 * recognized ( more can be defined by specific modules in the future ).
 *
 * \par Offset
 * 
 * Layers are render like a sphere centered around the camera. For many sky layers this
 * is the best choice. Some layers types though look strange in with a pure spherical
 * calculation. For example clouds would look like diving down into the horizon if
 * represented spherical. To get a more realistic look the clouds should get flatter
 * towards the horizon. This is due to the viewer residing on the earth surface sees
 * the cloud layer sphere from a different location than the center of the sphere is.
 * Using offsets this situation can be simulated resulting in better cloud effects.
 * The offset is relative to the sphere thus measured in the range from -1 to 1. For
 * clouds try a value of -0.9 to shift the cloud sphere down into the ground by roughly
 * 90% of the sphere radius. The rotation is always applied before the offset.
 * 
 * \par Rotation
 * 
 * The etRotation* rotation is applied ontop of the layer orientation. This allows to
 * define planetary movement with the layer orientation representing the planet orbit
 * coordinate frame and etRotationX for example rotating the planet along the x axis
 * easily.
 * 
 * \par Sky Box
 * The sky layer renders as a sky box. A sky box composes of 6 images for
 * each side of an imaginary cube onto the inside the sky is projected.
 * A sky box layer complete covers the entire sky and is therefore suitable
 * for the first layer in a sky. You can also use this layer ontop of other
 * layers if you use images with transparency or using the alpha value of the
 * blending color. The skin assigned to the layer contains the sky box images.
 * There have to be six textures inside the skin named "sky.box.left",
 * "sky.box.right", "sky.box.top", "sky.box.bottom", "sky.box.back" and
 * "sky.box.front" representing the respective image. The names are defined
 * as constants for the graphic modules.
 *
 * \par Sky Sphere
 * The sky layer renders as a sky sphere. Sky spheres are often called sky
 * domes especially if they cover only 180 degrees of the sky. The sky sphere
 * can cover optionally 180 or 360 of the sky. A sky sphere composes of 2
 * images one for the top half of the sphere and the other for the bottom half.
 * The top image is mandatory but the bottom one is not required if the player
 * can never see the lower half of the sphere. A sky sphere layer can completely
 * cover the entire sky and is therefore suitable for the first layer in a sky.
 * You can also use this layer ontop of other layers if you use images with
 * transparency or using the alpha value of the blending color. The images for
 * the individual sphere halves have to be in a sphere mapping compatible form.
 * These sky textures usually are of rectangular form with a width to height
 * ratio of 2 to 1. Light probe sky textures are not supported by this layer
 * type. The skin assigned to the layer contains the sky sphere images. There
 * has to be at least the top image and optionall the bottom image. The textures
 * have to be named "sky.sphere.top" and "sky.sphere.bottom" representing the
 * respective image. The names are defined as constants for the graphic modules.
 *
 * \par Sky Bodies
 * The sky layer is rendered as a collection of individual celestrical bodies.
 * All contained bodies can be placed individually but are moved all together
 * with the layer. This kind of layer is useful for either a single celestrical
 * body like the sun or the moon or a collection of individual bodies like clouds
 * moving together. Especially with clouds using 2 or 3 layers can be used to
 * simulate clouds at different altitude moving due to different wind influence.
 * Since this layer type covers only partially the sky it is not suited as the
 * first layer but well suited for drawing bodies ontop of existing layers. The
 * skin assigned to the layer is used as the source of images for the individual
 * bodies. Each body specifies the index of the texture to use from the skin.
 * Therefor all images for all bodies inside the same layer have to be stored in
 * the same skin.
