/**
 * \brief Sky Bodies Layer Body.
 *
 * Defines a body in a sky bodies layer. For positioning the body the
 * sky is considered to be a sphere of unit radius. The position of
 * the body is then defined using a quaternion rotation. At identity
 * rotation the body is located at the equator at the 0Â° meridian
 * which is the same as the body located 1 unit along the Z-Axis.
 * The size of the body is defined using two angles measured in
 * radians. The angles indicate the entire width and height of the
 * body not half the width and height. This angle is comparable to
 * the astronomic angle under which you see a body in the sky. The
 * body is drawn using the given image which can use transparency.
 * Furthermore a color including transparency can be defined which
 * is multiplied component wise with the image pixels.
