 * \brief Base resource class.
 * 
 * Provides the basic class for all resources. Each resource is assigned
 * the resource manager it originates from and a reference count. If you
 * want to add a reference to this resource do so using the AddReference
 * function. If you want to free the reference you have added before use
 * the FreeReference function and do not call 'delete' on the resource.
 * Once you receive as resource manager subclass the RemoveResource call
 * you have to use 'delete' to dispose of the resource and only then.
