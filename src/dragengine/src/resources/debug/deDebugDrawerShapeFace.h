/**
 * \brief Debug drawer volume face.
 *
 * Describes a face in a debug drawer shape. These faces can have any
 * number of vertices where all vertices are considered to be coplanar.
 * The face normal is specified explicity to avoid troubles in cases
 * where vertices are very close together. This way an application or
 * module wishing for some debug drawing does not have to worry about
 * badly spaced vertices which makes debug code more simple. The face
 * is considered to be a triangle fan type face. Hence the first vertex
 * is the base vertex and the second vertex the first triangle base.
 * Every next vertex defines a triangle with the first vertex, the
 * last vertex and the newly specified vertex. The triangle fan is not
 * closesed automatically. For filled shapes at least 3 vertices are
 * required and for non filled shapes at least 2. If not enough
 * vertices are specified the face not drawn.
