/**
 * \brief Resource Loader.
 * 
 * Loads resources asynchronously. To load a resource a scripting module places a load request.
 * Requests are processed using <em>Parallel Processing</em> system of the game engine. The
 * scripting module has to query the resource loader during each frame update for new entries
 * in the retrieval queue. Once there are no more entries in the queue the scripting module
 * can carry on with the fram update.
 * 
 * Requests for the same resource are grouped together and placed in the retrieval queue only
 * once. The scripting module is responsible to track multiple requests for the same resource.
 * A resource is uniquely identified by the path and resource type. This information are also
 * returned in retrieval queries and can be used to match up with one or more requests made by
 * the game scripts.
 * 
 * Loading certain resources can add internal loading requests not started by the scripting
 * module. The scripting module has to deal with resources finished loading which have not
 * been requested.
 * 
 * Resource loading is supported for the following resource types:
 * - Animation
 * - Font
 * - Image
 * - LanguagePack
 * - Model
 * - OcclusionMesh
 * - Rig
 * - Skin
 * - Sound
 * - Video
