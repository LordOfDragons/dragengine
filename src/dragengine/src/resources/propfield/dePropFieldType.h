/**
 * \brief Prop Field Type.
 *
 * Defines a prop type in a prop field. Each prop type has a static model,
 * a skin and a list of instances. Each instance uses the parameters of
 * the type but has a specific placement. Instances are projected onto the
 * hosting surface. For performance and memory reasons the number of
 * instances is an immutable parameter given during construction time. In
 * games you need to init this number anyways only during loading time and
 * during run time the number is constant. Editors can recreate the type
 * to alter the count of instances. The parent prop field allows to mutate
 * the list of types so this restriction is not a road blocking one.
