/**
 * \brief Occlusion Mesh.
 * 
 * Defines an occlusion mesh used to help graphic modules to improve occlusion testing
 * if supported. Occlusion meshes are optional but potentially improve performance.
 * Occlusion meshes are similar to models in that they support bone weights but they
 * do not support LOD nor textures or texture coordinate sets. Faces are classified
 * in single sided and double sided. Single sided is useful to define occlusion only
 * in the direction in front of a faces. In contrary to models an occlusion mesh face
 * can have more than 3 corners as long as they are all coplanar and convex. corners
 * are the vertices used in the faces and are stored as a continuous array of vertex
 * indices. Each face defines the number of corners it contains in clockwise order.
