 * class provided (although you are free to do differently if you really
 * know what you are doing). The RemoveResource function is protected
 * and has to be used only by a deResource derived object to notify the
 * resource manager that this object has to be freed from memory. Do not
 * do any reference counting inside the subclass. If a resource is ready
 * to be freed it will tell you by calling RemoveResource.
