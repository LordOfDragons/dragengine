/**
 * \brief Particle Emitter.
 * 
 * Emits particles in the form of billboards. The position and
 * orientation of the particle emitter defines where particles are
 * produced and in which direction they are cast. The cast parameters
 * are picked randomly between the minimum and maximum value. The state
 * of particles is stored individually by the physics module. The
 * Physics module has to provide the graphics related particle states
 * for the Graphics module in addition to any internal states required
 * for the simulation. This shared information has to be provided using
 * an array of sParticle elements. The position of the particles are
 * relative to the emitter position. The Scripting Module will be notified
 * by the Physics Module about collisions of particles with world.
 * 
 * \par Intermodule Communication
 * The Physics and Graphic module require communication dealing with
 * particles to make them fast. This communication breaks up into different
 * stages. First the Graphic Module stores in the particle emitter how the
 * particle states have to be stored. This is done using the graphic module
 * request parameters. Using these the Physics Module can provide the states
 * in the favorable way. Once the Physics Module has done a simulation step
 * it creates or updates a particle array. This array is then stored in the
 * particle emitter. The array stays valid until the next time the Physics
 * Module simulates the particles. In the mean time the Graphic Module can
 * use the particle array stored in the emitter to render the particles.
 * 
 * \par Graphic Module Requests
 * The Graphic Module can place a couple of requests in the particle emitter
 * for the Physics Module to respect. The data in the particles array are
 * stored in compressed form using mostly bytes for individual parameters
 * where possible. This not only reduces the amount of memory required and
 * transfered it also allows Graphic Modules to place particle data in
 * textures. Graphic Modules have in general two possible ways to handle a
 * large amount of particles and this is either by storing the data inside
 * an input-stream type GPU memory or inside textures. This system allows
 * the Graphic Module to drive particle rendering either way without the
 * Physics Module requiring to know. Due to the compressed nature though
 * limits are required to define a proper mapping. The linear velocity is
 * split into four values three defining the direction and the fourthed
 * defining the magnitude of the velocity. The direction is stored stored
 * with each component as bytes mapping -1 to char -127 and 1 to char 127.
 * The magnitude maps 0 m/s to byte 0 and the maximum linear velocity to
 * byte 255. The maximum velocity is set using SetMaxLinearVelocity and
 * defaults to 1 m/s. The rotation maps 0째 to byte 0 and 360째 to byte 255.
 * This gives a step of roughly 1.4째 per byte which is not a big problem
 * for particles as they are in general small objects. A problem would arise
 * with large particles like smoke but for these objects exists resources
 * on their own simulating them better than particles can do. The angular
 * velocity maps -maxAngularVelocity to char -127 and maxAngularVelocity to
 * char 127. The maximum angular velocity can be set using
 * SetMaxAngularVelocity. For the velocities exists an additional option to
 * store them squared instead of their true value. Using squared velocities
 * a finer grained step size is used for velocities close to 0 while larger
 * velocities have a coarser grained step size. To request squared velocities
 * use SetSquareVelocities. The cast time parameters map the lower cast
 * value to char -127 and the upper cast value to char 127. No additional
 * limits are required since these cast value boundaries provide already a
 * mapping. If the upper and lower cast value is the same or nearly the same
 * any value can be used as all values map to the same cast parameter value.
 * Typically char 0 is though used. In addition to these request parameters
 * the Graphic Module can request to drive particle simulation on its own
 * instead of handing this off to the Physics Module. This can be done using
 * SetGraphicModuleSimulates. If set the Graphic Module is responsible to
 * drive the entire simulation. The Physics Module is going to ignore this
 * particle emitter altogether. This is useful for particle emitters not
 * affected by physics like for example spell casting particle effects.
 * For these simplified simulations can be used which often can be driven
 * entirely on the GPU.
