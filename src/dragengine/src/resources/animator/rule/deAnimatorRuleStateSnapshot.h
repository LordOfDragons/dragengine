/**
 * \brief Animator State Snapshot Rule Class.
 *
 * A simple rule that applies the current state in the bound component as the new
 * animation state. Useful if you want to blend from an unknown animation state
 * ( like for example after having the physics module altered the state or being
 * in the middle of some other animation ) to a new one without jumping. Also no
 * additional controllers in this rule. You can use the same blending trick
 * mentioned in the examples with this rule.<br>
 * <br>
 * Similar to the last state rule but with an small difference: state is saved.
 * Hence you have to manually create a snapshot of a state ( either from the
 * component or some animation frame ). This snapshot is then used as the new
 * animation state. Also here no additional controllers. The same blending
 * example can be used here too. State snapshots can be useful if you want a
 * certain situation to influence an animation for a longer time after it
 * happened.<br>
 * <br>
 * More rules will be added later on. The system might look a bit daunting at
 * the beginning but with the right abstraction layer in the scripting module
 * this is rather easy to use. Once setup you only have to alter the controllers
 * and from time to time the move names in the rules all of which is a single
 * function call.
