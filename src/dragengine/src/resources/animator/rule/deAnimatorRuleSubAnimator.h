/**
 * \brief Sub Animator Rule.
 * The sub animator rule uses the state of another animator as the
 * state of this rule. This allows to extend animators without
 * recreating the structure in every animator based on a common
 * base. The additional list of connections determines which
 * controller value in the animator this rule belongs to is
 * written to which controller in the sub animator. When the
 * animator is assigned the connections are created with the
 * number of controllers in the sub animator initialized to map
 * to the 0 local controller no matter if it exists or not. If the
 * sub animator changes especially in terms of controller count
 * you have to detach and reattach it again and update the
 * connections again.
