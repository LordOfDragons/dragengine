/**
 * \brief Animator Rule Class.
 * \details
 * Animator rules are the construction unit of an animator. There are
 * many different ways how an animation can be produced so the rules
 * are split into different classes providing different functionality.
 * The animator rule class is the base class for all the various rule
 * classes. To make life easier this class provides two ways to work
 * with the rule classes. One way is visiting and the other is safe
 * casting. Both ways have their advantage in the right situation.
 * Furthermore the base class provides some common functionality that
 * all rules share. Each rule can have one or more controllers and
 * bones assigned. The subclass DE_DLL_EXPORT decides how many of those controllers
 * are used. Hence specifying more than one controller for a rule
 * using only one controller does not hurt. The rule in question simply
 * uses the first controller then. Rules can be disabled to take them
 * out of the production process easy without requiring to remove and
 * add them from the animator. The list of bones specifies on what
 * bones the rule operates. For ease of use a back reference to the
 * animator is stored. This reference is a weak reference.
 * The blending is controlled with the source and destination blend
 * factor similar to the ones in the animator.
