 * Adjusts the existing animation to match a different rig. For this
 * a source and destination rig as well as a list of bone matchings
 * have to be provided. The source rig defines the structure of the
 * existing animation data. The destination rig defines the structure
 * to match the animation to. The destination rig can be NULL in
 * which case the rig from the attached component is used. The bone
 * matching list defines pairs of bone names assigning bones from the
 * existing animation to a new bone. Bones without such a matching
 * are assumed to stay the same but with different rest poses.
