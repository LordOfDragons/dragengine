/**
 * \brief Animator Instance Class.
 * 
 * Animators are objects capable of producing an animation state for a
 * component. Every animator composes of a set of rules and controllers
 * which indicate how the final animation state is produced from a set
 * animation. While animators define this production process the animator
 * instance is required to actually apply an animator to a component. This
 * is done for two main reasons. First animators can be shared this way
 * across multiple components without having to create a unique copy for
 * each component. This allows the game to organize animations more
 * efficiently. The second reason is the simple support for animation
 * retargeting. If the rig specified in the animator does not match the
 * rig in the component used in the instance automatic retargeting is
 * conducted. This way the user does not have to think about specifying
 * retargeting explicitely nor does he have to worry about when this is
 * required. The same animator can therefore be used for all kinds of
 * components as long as the rigs used in the components are similar
 * enough to the rig used in the animator (not a requirement but for good
 * results a good practise). More than one animator can act on one component
 * one after the other if complex animations are required that can not be
 * done using one single animator. Animators can not be used at the same
 * time as a collider component if the rig of the component is driven by
 * physics. Animators can though be used if the rig is kinematic.
