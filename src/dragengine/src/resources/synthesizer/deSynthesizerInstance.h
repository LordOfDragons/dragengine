/**
 * \brief Synthesizer instance producing source using a synthesizer.
 * 
 * Every synthesizer contains a set of sources and controllers indicating how the final sound
 * is produced. While synthesizers define this production process the synthesizer instance
 * produces the actual sound using per instance parameters.
 * 
 * \par Module interaction
 * 
 * Synthesizer instance has module interaction between synthesizer and audio module.
 * 
 * The audio module calls GenerateSound() to obtain continuous sound to play. The synthesizer
 * module will update internal states if required whenever GenerateSound() is called.
 * 
 * Because this requires the audio module and the synthesizer module to use the same sound
 * data format it is not allowed for the user to change the synthesizer object while it is
 * in use. It is thus correct for the audio module to assume the synthesizer format parameters
 * (bytes per sample, channel count and sample rate) to stay constant as long as the synthesizer
 * is assigned. Inconsistencies created by the user incorrectly manipulating the synthesizer
 * object while it is in use has to be catched by the synthesizer module throwing an exception.
 * 
 * The audio module can call Reset() on the synthesizer instance any time it wants to reset
 * playback.
 * 
 * To allow performant synthesizing of sound the audio and synthesizer module are allowed to
 * run their work asynchronously. In particular this means GenerateSound() is allowed to be
 * called asynchronously while any manipulation of the synthesizer instance states (like
 * changing sample count or controller curves) is allowed only by the main thread.
 * The synthesizer module has to be prepared to deal with this asynchronous handling safely.
 * 
 * Synthesizers can not be shared. If done so problems will most likely happen.
