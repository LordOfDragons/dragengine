/**
 * \brief Synthesizer controller.
 * 
 * Controllers provide the user with control over how the individual sounds of a synthesizer
 * produce the final sound. Controllers are written in a way that you can use them without
 * having to do scaling or transformation on your own. You can provide a minimum and maximum
 * value matching your setup. The controller takes care of transforming the current value
 * into the proper 0 to 1 range required for sounds to work with. The current value is
 * calculated using an value curve set by the user. The play position is used to sample the
 * curve producing the controller values over time.
