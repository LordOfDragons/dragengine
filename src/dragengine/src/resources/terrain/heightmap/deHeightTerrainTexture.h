/**
 * \brief Height Terrain Mesh Texture.
 *
 * Texture definition for a height terrain. Textures with an alpha mask assigned
 * are blended ontop of the other layers using the alpha mask. Textures with
 * splats assigned are handled differently. Each splat is rendered using the skin
 * of the parent texture. This allows for very complex and rich terrains with a
 * small amount of disk space required but requires powerful Graphic Modules.
 * Alpha mask textures are produced quick and render typically faster than splat
 * textures which require more work and tend to require a lot more memory
 * especially with high resolutions. The order of the texture defines the order
 * in which the textures are applied to the height terrain. Planar projection
 * along the negative y axis is used for mapping the textures. All other
 * parameters are free to be modified.
