/**
 * \brief Resource list.
 * 
 * The resource list class is the backend for resource management. This list
 * contains the main reference to the resource object. The list does not
 * call 'delete' on the resource object but removes the pointer to it.
 * The resource object calls 'delete' on itself thus never call it yourself
 * except one situation. If you have created a resource object and have not
 * added it to the resource list yet you have to use call 'delete' on it
 * yourself to avoid triggering RemoveResource on the resource manager.
 * 
 * \note Resources removed from the list are marked leaking. Basically this
 * clears their resource manager.
