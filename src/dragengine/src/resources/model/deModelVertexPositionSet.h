/**
 * \brief Model vertex position set.
 * 
 * Defines an additional named set of positions for all vertices. This is often called a
 * blend shape typically used for facial animation or correcting weighting issues.
 * Position count has to match the vertex count of the model lod this set belongs to.
 * 
 * Vertex position sets are relative to either the original model vertex position or another
 * vertex position set. Vertex position sets are blended like this (for each vertex):
 * 
 *   position = modelLod.vertex.position
 *   
 *   for set in sets
 *     if set.baseSet == -1
 *       position += (set.position[i] - modelLod.vertex.position) * set.weight
 *     else
 *       position += (set.position[i] - sets[set.baseSet].position[i]) * set.weight
 * 
 * Using a base vertex position instead of the original model vertex position allows to
 * create complex vertex position manipulations difficult to do otherwise.
 * 
 * Vertex position sets store only positions for some vertices. All vertices not defined
 * in a vertex position set use the original model vertex position.
