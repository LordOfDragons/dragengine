 * An effect chain holds a list of effects that are execute in the order
 * they have been added to the effect chain. The effect chain is a
 * convenience class that works with effects of various types so you do
 * not have to implement this every time. As this object is not reference
 * counted in any way the user class is responsible to free the effect
 * chain itself once the user class is destroyed.
