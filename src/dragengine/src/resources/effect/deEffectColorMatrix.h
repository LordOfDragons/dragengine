 * \brief Effect Color Matrix Class.
 *
 * Color Matrix effects are post processing effects that manipulate
 * the final image after rendering. Every pixel is transformed by
 * a given color matrix. This transformation is a linear transformation.
 * This effect is best used as the last effect in an effect chain since
 * most graphic modules can carry out such a transform as part of the
 * final image rendering in hardware.
