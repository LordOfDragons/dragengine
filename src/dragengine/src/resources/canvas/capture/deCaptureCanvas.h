/**
 * \brief Capture canvas.
 * 
 * Capture canvas allows to capture the rendering result of a canvas view into an
 * deImage resource. Capturing is done by the graphic module during the next frame
 * rendering. During the next deGraphicSystem::RenderWindows() call or at the end
 * of the current deGraphicSystem::RenderWindows() call the result is stored back
 * into the capture canvas. Whichever is the case depends on the rendering
 * method of the graphic module. You know when the result is ready \em capture is
 * set to false. The image resource is created by the caller and allows to
 * request the result in a specific size and format. To do a successful capturing
 * of a render view you have to do the following:
 * - set image to a valid deImage object.
 * - set \em capture to true.
 * - during the next one or two deGraphicSystem::RenderWindows() calls check if
 * \em capture is false.
 * You can capture the canvas view of a render window or any other canvas view
 * similar to a deCanvasCanvas.
