 * \brief Component Texture.
 * Texture definition for a component. For simple components a single skin is
 * assigned from which the contained textures are mapped to the model textures.
 * For more control the individual textures can be assigned different skins.
 * This is useful for components used as static terrain geometry and for editing
 * applications as this way individual textures can be assigned at run-time.
 * If the skin is NULL the matching texture of the skin assigned to the component
 * itself is used. Otherwise the first texture in the assigned skin is used to
 * replace the texture.
