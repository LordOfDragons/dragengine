/**
 * \brief Scripting System.
 *
 * Provides support for an external scripting or programming language.
 * This is the only system that can not change during the run of a game
 * not even during engine-break time. The scripts drive the entire
 * engine and should provide an interface ( abstraction layer ) between
 * the engine and engine systems towards the game developer. The amount
 * of access to the engine functionality is depending on the scripting
 * module used.
 *
 * \note
 * Currently the system sends events directly to the scripting system.
 * It would be better to avoid this by giving the scripting system the
 * chance to retrieve the events itself from a queue. The best idea
 * would be to create an event queue in the engine object that the
 * input system writes to and that the scripting system retrieves from.
 * Conversion of events has to be done anyways.
