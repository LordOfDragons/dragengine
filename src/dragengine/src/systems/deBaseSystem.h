/**
 * \brief Base System Class.
 *
 * A system describes the behaviour and capabilities of a well defined
 * group of operations belonging to a specific set of tasks. There exist
 * two kinds of systems. The modules itself are handled by an external
 * class but each system also contains a list of modules usable with
 * that system. Except the scripting system all can be shut down and
 * restarted during engine-break time.
 *
 * \par Single Type Systems
 * This kind of systems can have only one module of their kind running
 * at the same time. This class provides the base for those kind of
 * systems. Those systems are also the only ones who can provide
 * peer objects for certain engine objects. Single type systems can also
 * be shut down and restarted during engine-break scenarios. The module
 * used by each system is defined at the beginning of execution and can
 * be changed during engine-break time.
 *
 * \par Multiple Type Systems
 * This kind of systems can have multiple modules running at the same
 * time. The deResourceManager class provides the base for systems of
 * that kind. Those system can not provide peer objects to engine objects.
 * This kind of systems is used for loading and saving file formats.
 * The modules used by those systems can be shut down and restarted
 * individually during engine-break time. What modules are used depends
 * on the file type to handle.
