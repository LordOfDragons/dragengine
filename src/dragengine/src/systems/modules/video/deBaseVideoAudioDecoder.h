 * \brief Base video audio decoder peer.

 * chunks of audio data as block of samples. The file reader is held open as long as the
 * decoder exists. The user decides if the data is read synchronous or asynchronous.
 * The sound information is not replicated in the decoder but found in the source video resource.
