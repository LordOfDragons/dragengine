	 *   downloaded patches as used in auto updating online games.
	 * - mods: After 'patches'. Allowes to add containers providing game modifications
	 * - overlay: After 'mods' and before adding the user overlay directory. Allows
	 *   modules to add containers overriding all containers up to this point in time.
	 *   The user overlay directory is always aded after this stage. Hence user
	 *   overlay content is always used first before any other content.
