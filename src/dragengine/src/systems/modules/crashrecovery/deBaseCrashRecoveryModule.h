 * Crash Recovery Modules are responsible for handling errors during the execution
 * of the game engine. If anyone of the single type modules fails the crash recovery
 * module is fired up to allow the user to locate the error and recover from it.
 * Errors in the crash recovery module itself lead to an immediate termination of
 * the engine hence this is the module to pay special attention to in terms of
 * error safeness.
