/**
 * \brief Stepable task.
 *
 * Base class for stepable tasks. Such tasks split lengthy operations into
 * manageable work units so called steps. The length of one step is not
 * defined but should be reasonably small to tell the user visually that
 * the task is still working. Each task has an info text and progress
 * value to communicate to the user the current state. After each step the
 * GUI updates with the stored information. Two changed flags help to
 * avoid updating if nothing changed. They are set by this base class
 * therefore subclasses do not have to worry about those flags. Just set
 * the status whenever it changes and leave the hard work for this class.
 * The return value of the Step call indicates if further steps are
 * required or if the task finished. Progress is measured from 0 to 1
 * usually displayed as 100 percent.
