/**
 * \brief Editable Entity.
 * 
 * Base class for editable entities in editors. Usually there exists in each
 * editor one base class which stores the entity the editor is working on.
 * this class provides a bunch of typical parameters as well as listening
 * support and an undo system. Furthermore this class stores also a the game
 * engine, the game definition and the environment. Most editors require
 * access to these objects for proper operation so they are provided here out
 * of the box. For handling loading and saving the file path and the changed
 * and saved state is stored. The file path is stored as two string values.
 * The file path string stores the file path as selected by the user and is
 * an absolute path in the virtual file system of the IGDE. Besides this the
 * directory path is stored too representing the directory the file path is
 * located in. This is useful for editable entities which require to load
 * dependency files relative to the file location. This string value can be
 * used directly for engine resource managers as the base path. The changed
 * and saved states keep track if the file has been already saved and if the
 * entity has changed since the last time it has been saved. The SetChanged
 * and SetSaved methods send notifications if the respective state changed.
