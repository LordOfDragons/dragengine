/**
 * @brief Filter Objects By Class.
 *
 * A filter accepting objects based on their class name. Supports
 * inclusive or exclusive matching. Using inclusive matching only
 * objects with a class name matching any of the specified class
 * names are accepted. Using exclusive matching only objects with
 * a class name not matching any of the specified class names are
 * accepted. By default exclusive matching is used. In addition
 * an object to ignore can be specified. This is useful for
 * situations where an object should not accept itself. Furthermore
 * ghost objects can be accepted if required. By default ghost
 * objects are rejected.
