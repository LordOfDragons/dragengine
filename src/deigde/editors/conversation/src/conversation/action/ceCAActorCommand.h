/**
 * \brief Actor Command Conversation Action.
 * Sends a command to an actor, more precisely to the player action object assigned to it.
 * The command is a single text string parsed by the conversation script into an array of
 * arguments and then send to the player action. The format of the command depends on the
 * type of the player action the actor is using at the time of the command being send.
 * If the command is not understood or improperly formatted the player action does nothing.
 * Thus it is important to ensure make sure this action is used in the proper situation.
